## 🎯 Purpose

**Temporal Analyzer** is a foundational engineering measurement library.

It does not process raw time series or act as a generic statistical tool. Instead, it analyzes **observed systems** (e.g., engines, vehicles, industrial processes, physiological systems) via their **temporally synchronized state variables**.

The library strictly measures **state transitions** over time, producing deterministic, reproducible descriptions of system dynamics with rigorous **traceability** and mathematical **confidence**.

---

## ⚡ What It Does

- Analyzes **systems**, not isolated signals.
- Enforces **time** as the strict synchronization axis.
- Measures **state transitions** (the quantified change from one state to the next).
- Produces **deterministic engineering measurements**: trends, delays, correlations, synchronization, stability, and amplitude.
- Returns all results with a complete **Trace** and a derived **Confidence** metric.

## 🛑 What It Does NOT Do

- ❌ Predict or forecast future states.
- ❌ Provide domain-specific diagnoses (e.g., "the engine is failing").
- ❌ Optimize system behavior.
- ❌ Make decisions or generate warnings.
- ❌ Replace domain expertise.

## 🧭 Quick Navigation

For a first-time visitor, understanding the repository architecture should take less than five minutes. Start here:

1. **[Repository Constitution](docs/REPOSITORY_CONSTITUTION.md)** — The supreme law of the project. Read this first to understand the mission, strict scope, and forbidden responsibilities.
2. **[Canonical Specification](docs/CANONICAL_SPECIFICATION.md)** — The formal ontology, abstract API contracts, and strict error boundaries.
3. **[Implementation Notes](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)** — Reference guidelines for data types, serialization formats, and naming conventions to be used during code implementation.

### Architecture Audits & Release Documentation

- **[Document Classification](docs/DOCUMENT_CLASSIFICATION.md)** — Defines the authority level of all documentation.
- **[Architecture Freeze](docs/ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md)** — Explains the canonical conflict resolutions.
- **[Consistency Report](docs/CONSISTENCY_REPORT.md)** — Verification of internal consistency.
- **[Architecture Certificate](docs/ARCHITECTURE_CERTIFICATE.md)** — Formal declaration of the frozen 1.0 architecture state.
- **[Release Recommendation](docs/RELEASE_RECOMMENDATION.md)** — The RC1 readiness verdict.

## 🏛 Core Ontology

The fundamental flow of data through the Temporal Analyzer architecture:

```text
Observation
    ↓
System State
    ↓
Temporal Constraint (Time Axis)
    ↓
State Transition
    ↓
Engineering Measurement
    ├── Trace (for total reproducibility)
    └── Confidence (deterministic reliability)
```

*(Note: Domain interpretation and operational knowledge are strictly isolated to higher-level domain layers, outside the scope of this core library).*
